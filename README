Libcelmek was developed by Mattias Holm (lorrden at openorbit dot org).

Libcelmek is a celestial mechanics library, it implements many different
algorithms. Several algorithms are implemented from the Astronomical Algorithms
book by Jean Meeus, ISBN: 0-943396-35-2. In addition to those algorithms,
full precision VSOP87E and the IAU rotational model is also implemented.

There are two ways to compile the library, either with the Xcode project file or
using the CMake build system. Tests does at the moment only build using the
Xcode project however.

Documentation is lacking at the moment, but it will be added later on.
